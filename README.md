Morphometric Similarity analysis

A recently developed technique called Morphometric Similarity (Seidlitz et al., 2018) quantifies the interregional correlation of multiple morphometric measures in a single subject. 

The aim of this repo is, therefore, to introduce a longitudinal component and study the changes in morphometric similarity in schizoprenia patients and healthy subjects to check for case-control differences.

The file MS cross-sectional contains a function to carry out transversal Morphometric Similarity analyses, whereas the file MS longitudinal contains a function to carry out longitudinal Morphometric Similarity analyses.
